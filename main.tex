\section{Introduction}

The travel industry is a vast interconnected ecosystem of travelers and service providers, ranging from airlines to hotels, from restaurants to event organizers. Each entity in this network needs access to a variety of consumer data to optimally function and provide personalized, efficient, and exceptional services to travelers. However, the current data sharing model is highly fragmented and often exposes travelers to vulnerabilities.

Each journey a traveler undertakes begins with the planning stage, which involves an exchange of information. This information is shared with various travel service providers who further relay this data to various other entities involved in arranging the journey. It is not uncommon for the traveler to repetitively share and verify personal data, a practice that not only proves tiresome to the traveller but poses a significant risk to their privacy. Moreover, this vast amount of valuable generated data often remains scattered, under-utilized, or locked behind regulatory and privacy concerns.

Currently, the travel data supply chain involves countless intermediaries that collect, transfer and store personal consumer data. This legacy infrastructure was not designed to handle the sheer volume, variety, and velocity of the data currently generated by travelers, and is thus riddled with inefficiencies, redundancies, and is prone to data breaches.

Although advances in technology offer possibilities for optimizing the data supply chain, it is becoming increasingly clear that more than an upgrade, a paradigm shift is necessary. The privacy of users is increasingly being recognized as a fundamental right, creating additional legal, ethical, and practical obstacles for the current state of data handling in the travel industry. Moreover, as a traveler's journey becomes more digitized, the challenge of managing and protecting an ever-growing volume of sensitive data increases.

 In this paper we introduce Travlr ID, a cutting-edge solution that aims to solve the conundrum of data challenges in the travel industry through the use of decentralized technology. Our proposed model rethinks the way data is collected, stored, and shared, placing control back into the hands of consumers while providing efficient and effective solutions for service providers. As we dive deeper into this whitepaper, we will explore the structural design and functional benefits of Travlr ID and explore how it strives to revolutionize the travel data supply chain by harnessing cutting-edge techniques such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

\section{Travel Industry - Data Supply Chain}

In this digital age, almost every aspect of travel - be it the booking of flights, car rentals, hotels, adventures, or even dining experiences - depends heavily on data exchange. Travelers provide their personal and trip details, which are then processed by various travel service providers to create customized experiences. However, this flow of data, while necessary, has far-reaching implications related to privacy, security, and efficiency.

The data supply chain in the travel industry is convoluted, complex, and intricate. At every stage of a traveler’s journey – from initial reservation to final check-out – a multitude of entities collect, transmit and accumulate personal data. The global tourism industry, which accounted for 10.4\% of the world's GDP in 2019, involves significant data exchange.

Unfortunately, the immense complexity of this data supply chain presents a host of challenges for both consumers and service providers. While service providers face the challenge of efficiently handling and leveraging these data, consumers are increasingly concerned about their privacy and security.

Lets look at each of these challenges individually. 

\subsection{Data Fragmentation}

With each new reservation, flight check-in, or hotel stay, multiple data touchpoints are created. As it stands, the various entities involved, ranging from airlines to hotel chains, and from travel agencies to tourism attractions, operate in silos hoarding the data they generate. This fragmentation prevents a seamless and integrated customer experience while posing security risks, as each entity must protect the data from breaches.

Burgeoning technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics have great potential to revolutionize the travel industry, but the siloed nature of the data prevents these tools from reaching their full potential. Moreover, repeated collection and verification of data at each step is both a headache for the customer and an operational inefficiency.

\subsection{Privacy Challenges}

Currently, there is an apparent gap in the travel data management landscape. The industry lacks a centralized, secure and efficient data sharing protocol, which prevents the optimization of services and the smooth transition of services from one provider to another. Consumers also lack the ability to control who accesses their data and for what purpose, raising privacy concerns.

Several data breaches over the years have highlighted the vulnerability of existing systems. Therefore, the need for a paradigm shift in data management in the travel industry cannot be overstressed. Next-generation solutions need to revolve around improved data security, improved interoperability, and giving control back to consumers.

\subsection{Need for Blockchain}

This section takes a deep dive into the innovative world of blockchain technology, explaining its concepts, functionalities, and potential benefits it could bring to the travel industry. Highlighting emerging concepts such as Zero-knowledge proofs, we aim to elaborate on how blockchain could pave the way for a new era in data management.

\subsubsection{Digital Ledger}

Simply put, a blockchain is a digital ledger, a secure chain of blocks that stores data across multiple systems, ensuring decentralization and preventing any single entity from having sole authority over data. Every block is secured using cryptographic principles, ensuring data is extremely difficult to alter or manipulate once written into the chain.

Newer technologies like Zero-knowledge proofs enhance this security even further. Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true, without conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true. This strengthens privacy, as no specific details need to be revealed during the verification of transactions.

\subsubsection{Benefits \& Advantages}

Known for its decentralization, transparency, and security, blockchain technology has garnered immense interest from various industries, and rightfully so. It ensures data integrity, eliminates intermediaries, reduces the potential for fraud, and promises enhanced privacy through techniques like Zero-knowledge proofs. 

As a decentralized technology, blockchain forms a network of peer-to-peer transactions. Its transparency fosters trust among users, as all transaction data (excluding private details protected by zero-knowledge proofs or similar protocols) is visible to every participant of the chain.

\subsubsection{Travel industry applications}

Blockchain offers a multitude of benefits in the travel sector, notably improving efficiency, security, and consumer trust. Airlines can use it to manage frequent flyer points and baggage tracking. Hotels could use it for room booking and travel agencies for maintaining secure and transparent ticketing.

By enabling permissioned data sharing (like via Travlr ID), customer verification becomes smooth, yet secure. Furthermore, the implementation of Zero-knowledge proofs can help demonstrate the validity of a traveler's credentials without having to expose any sensitive personal information.

The potential extends to overcoming regulatory hurdles like GDPR, as blockchain technology allows for a system where customers have the power to decide who can access their data, adding another layer of data protection and privacy.

\subsection{Summary}

Today, the data in their current form remain in \textbf{disjoint silos} within the industry, hindering the ability to gain complete insight at the various stages of the traveler’s journey. Each step often requires separate data submission and verification, leading to redundancy and inefficiencies. The problems arising from these fragmented systems can inevitably erode the customer experience.

\textbf{Security} represents another significant challenge, as data breaches become increasingly common in the global digital landscape. In 2019 alone, Marriott International, one of the largest hotel chains in the world, declared that 383 million guest records were compromised, including 5 million passport numbers.

In addition, the problem is exacerbated when considering the multitude of local, national, and international \textbf{regulations} governing the use, storage, and transfer of personal data. Stringent acts such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require solid data handling infrastructures and practices, penalizing companies up to 4\% of their global revenue for violations.

The existing data management approach in the travel sector is plagued by fragmentation, under-use, security risks, and legal obstacles. These issues collectively underscore the critical and immediate need for an all-encompassing solution that can simplify the travel data supply chain while protecting data security, confidentiality, and adherence to regulations.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Components}

\subsubsection{Consumer Vaults}

A fundamental part of the Travlr ID architecture is the Consumer Vaults. It acts as a digital locker, where consumers can securely store all their personal and travel-related data. Blockchain technology's decentralized nature ensures that the control of these data lies solely with the consumer.

What sets the Travlr ID’s vault apart is ease and control. Using their private keys, consumers decide what information is shared and with whom, ensuring complete control over their personal data. Advanced features like Zero-knowledge proofs can be incorporated, allowing verification of credentials without sharing the actual information.

This not only personalizes their experience, but significantly reduces the need for re-verification at every stage of the travel process, thereby saving time and improving efficiency.

\subsubsection{Service Provider Vaults}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{travlr_diagram_5.png}
    \caption{Service provider vaults}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

To complete the data-sharing cycle, service providers, such as hotels, airlines, and car rental agencies, can also run their vaults. These vaults can interact with the consumers' vaults and collect necessary data, post receiving permissions.

The adoption of this vault system by service providers ensures a streamlined and efficient data collection and usage process. It negates the need for data reentry, verification at every stage, providing seamless services and a more personalized experience for the traveler.

The service provider vaults can also collect and store data generated during the interactions with the customers. With consumer permission, this information can be used to optimize services and offerings, reinventing the way they interact with and understand their customers.

\subsubsection{Decentralised AI Agents}

Using the power of artificial intelligence, Travlr ID aims to increase the efficiency and personalization of the travel experience. Our Decentralized AI Agents interact with both the consumer and service provider vaults. Consumers and service providers grant permission to these AI agents to use data as needed for deal discovery, event identification, and service personalisation.

The AI agents, while processing large chunks of data, adhere strictly to privacy guidelines and blockchain's secure framework. They can help from the planning phase of a trip, suggesting itinerary based on past travel patterns, through to tracking flight schedules in real time and suggesting adjustments as necessary. 

\subsection{Network Infrastructure}

The development of the Travlr ID ecosystem is a complex endeavor. It requires the creation of a secure and scalable decentralized network infrastructure capable of supporting the high-throughput needs of the contemporary travel industry, while also adhering to the standards of privacy and security.

\subsubsection{Data nodes - Service providers}

The nodes form the backbone of any blockchain-based system. They are the individual parts of the larger data structure that validate and relay transactions. In the Travlr ID ecosystem, these nodes will be primarily deployed and managed by the consortium of travel service providers. These nodes will generate income for the service providers and contribute towards the value of the network. 

Every service provider, such as hotels and airlines, can run their own on-premises nodes. These nodes collect and store the data generated by consumers when they interact with these service providers. The data stored in these nodes are secured and can be shared only when the consumer delegates access to another entity on the network.

This approach has several advantages. It ends the practice of transferring large amounts of data over the network, reducing network load. It also gives service providers a better opportunity to manage and monetize their customer data. 

By running an on-premises node, the service provider also becomes a participant in the Travlr ID network, contributing to the overall stability and security of the platform. It is also worth noting that although these nodes are deployed by individual service providers, they follow strict data management and security protocols dictated by the Travlr ID architecture.

The Travlr ID network's on-prem nodes perform the dual role - they ensure swift and safe consumer interactions at the service provider end while strengthening the overall Travlr ID ecosystem.

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{travlr_diagram_6.png}
    \caption{Service provider \& Smart contracts}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Smart contracts}

At the heart of the Travlr ID blockchain platform is its primary smart contract. A smart contract is a self-executing contract in which the terms of the agreement are written in code. They are a crucial component in ensuring the immutability, security, and trustless nature of the platform.

The primary smart contract in Travlr ID acts as the protocol for the exchange of data between consumer vaults and service provider vaults. Establishes the rules for data control, access, validation, and the level of disclosure depending on user permissions. This smart contract codifies the "rules of engagement" when interacting with a user's vault, ensuring all transactions comply with these rules.

Given the varying nature of different travel service providers, the smart contract is designed with flexibility to accommodate different types of data and interactions. At each step of integrating a service provider into the Travlr ID network, smart contracts can be extended or customized to handle the unique interactions and data requirements for that provider.

This smart contract is being deployed on an EVM blockchain, serving as the foundational layer for the decentralized network. Ensure that all data transactions are secure, private, and transparent.

In essence, the primary smart contract is the driving force that facilitates and governs the secure sharing and transaction of data on the Travlr ID platform. It ensures that the principles of blockchain, such as decentralization and security, while integrating advanced techniques like zero-knowledge proofs, are met in a proper way.
